# What is this?

This is my simplistic Qt5 frontend for umu-launcher (previously named ULWGL) that can use Valves Proton to launch Windows game on Linux. The name is a subject to change.

This launcher is for a hobby project and for personal use.

Umu-launcher needs to be installed on your system
https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher

In the directory run
```shell
qmake
```
And
```shell
make
```
To make executable in the directory

```shell
make install
```
To install it to /usr/bin
