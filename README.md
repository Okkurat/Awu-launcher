# NOTE

This is work in process and the application is not ready yet. Games can be launched and winetricks and winecfg can be used, but no config files can be created.

# What is this?

This is my simplistic Qt5 frontend for umu-launcher (previously named ULWGL) that can use Valves Proton to launch Windows game on Linux. The name is a subject to change.

This launcher is for a hobby project and for personal use.

Umu-launcher needs to be installed on your system
https://github.com/Open-Wine-Components/umu-launcher
In the directory run
```cd build
```
In the directory run
```shell
cmake ..
```
And
```shell
make
```
To make executable in the directory

```shell
sudo make install
```
To install it to /usr/bin
